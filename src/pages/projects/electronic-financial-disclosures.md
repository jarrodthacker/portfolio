Most applications that I've worked on in my day jobs are either internal, classified, or SaaS apps for a company - not a lot of publically available sites. Every once in a while at the Senate I got to work on something that constituents get to use too!

Electronic Financial Disclosures (eFD) is a web app that allows senators, candidates, and staff to file public disclosures describing their financials as it's legally required by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. There is also an admin application used to process disclosures.

In this project I worked on updating the front-end of the eFD application, which was built using Django and Bootstrap 2. I was responsible for the design and implementation of the front-end, which included the creation of a custom Bootstrap theme, and I worked with two other developers. When I was introduced to the project, it became clear that it needed to be updated to current UI standards, so I updated the application using the Bootstrap 4 framework, which at the time was still in its beta.

I also took steps to improve the accessibility of the applications by auditing for potential issues like missing form labels, skip links, keyboard access, or contrast issues and resolved them.
