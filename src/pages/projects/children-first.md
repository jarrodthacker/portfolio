Full disclosure: I made this site to help my mother-in-law, who works as a director at a daycare in Tennessee, post information to parents during the COVID-19 lockdown.

I designed the site in-browser, made some background assets in Sketch, and developed and deployed it as a static HTML site in a day and a half using Netlify (too easy).

I used Parcel for the first time (also a pleasant tool) to run a local hot-reloading server and compile the SCSS, and I used Netlify's form service to send emails to the daycare's email address.

The overall site was a success, and the daycare was able to communicate with parents quickly and easily. I keep the site up to date with new information as needed so I may consider a shift to a simple CMS, like Keystone.js or Sanity, in the future.
