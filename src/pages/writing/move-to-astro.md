After rolling with a static HTML portfolio site for ages (with outdated info), I'm finally moving my personal site to something with some templating (HTML Includes, where are you?!?).

This isn't the first time that I've tried a redesign. In the last few years, I've started moves to Gatsby (my first ever tussel with React, so it was doomed), Hugo, and Eleventy, but for whatever reasons those efforts have fallen to the wayside.

I am really intrigued by Astro, though, as I already enjoy being component-forward in just about every project I've worked on lately, and I love file-based routing. Just with static site generators like Hugo and Jekyll, the developer-experience to authoring-experience ratio feels really good too. Drafting content in Markdown is just so quick, and having access to my most comforable language, JavaScript, might just let me pull off all the little extras I always want to try to do when I spin up new personal sites.

Let's see where this goes.
