I was contracted by the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI) to redesign their website. ABI is a large U.S. non-profit that offers training and conferences for people in the bankruptcy industry - lawyers, judges, accountants, and more.

The site is built using Drupal, as that is their legacy content management system, and I was responsible for the design and implementation of a custom Drupal theme to modernize the site, which had hundreds of unique pages and layouts, with a particular focus on improving the mobile experience. I have worked with ABI on several occasions on small conference or special project sites, but the scope of this project was tremendously larger. Luckily, I had great support from the staff web developer, who was able to instruct me on the eccentricities of Drupal's templating and hooks systems, and the site's custom modules.

The overall design was very successful and accepted by the client, and the site has been well-received by the industry. The overall performance of the site from a rendering/loading metric I would like to improve, but found myself often bouncing against contraints of the Drupal server-side rendering strategy. I continue to work with this client to make updates and fixes as needed, and I also help introduce new frontend technologies where appropriate, such as drop-in Vue.js for more interactive components.
